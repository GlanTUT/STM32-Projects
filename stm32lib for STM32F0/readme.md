##stm32lib is a C++ library created for STM32 microcontrollers##
I designed a project using the STM32F051. This project was controlling WS2812B's and using nRF24L01p modules.
To make this work, i wrote a kind of library in C++ based on the STM32F051.
Below you can find the code. Enjoy, and use at your own risk!
